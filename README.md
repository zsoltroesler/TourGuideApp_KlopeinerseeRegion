**Project #6: Tour guide app**

Project overview: The goal is to create a tour guide app which presents relevant information to a user whoâ€™s visiting the place. It can contain all the best known secrets that only locals know. I chose South Carinthia region in Austia, which is unique combination of lakes and mountainous landscape.
